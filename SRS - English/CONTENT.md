# Introduction

This document explains and analyzes the requirements of the project "LTC" (Learning Types Classifier), developed by a university student of Software Engineering Career.

  ## Purpose
  
  The purpose of this document is to describe the general functioning of the LTC project, which is defined as a software solution to the problem of classifying the types of learning of children in the basic education degree.

  This solution will provide greater ease, speed and efficiency to the process of identification of types of learning because with its implementation will be possible to reduce the time, material cost and errors in the process. In addition, the information collected may be easy to access and retrieve for later uses.

  
  ## Scope  
  
  The system has the name “Learning Types Classifier” because it is basically designed to identify and classify the types of learning of children of basic education according to their preferences.

  LTC will be a useful tool for teachers at Plan de Iguala Elementary School in this identification process; will be responsible for handling student data including a description of their profile according to their interests, tips and techniques to achieve better learning and, of course, information about the type of learning they have.

  The main beneficiary with the LTC will be the academic institutions that implement it. The objective of using this system is to optimize processes in time and material resources.
 
 
  ## Definitions, acronymus, and abbreviations
    
  -LTC: Learning Types Classifier.
  
  -SRS: Software Requirements Specification.

  ## Overview
  
  The SRS document for the TLC project is divided into the following sections:
  
  •The introduction section that focuses on the explanation, objectives and description of the document.
  
  •The general description section oriented to the general description of the system, where the information is directed to the client or potential user.
  
  •The specific requirements section that talks about the specific requirements. This includes technical terms directed principally to the developers and programmers of the project.
  
  •The support information section contains the appendices and links of information related to the topic for general interest.
